# Europe's Top Forwards – npxG Overperformance (2024/25 Season)

This project ranks the top 10 forwards across Europe's Big 5 leagues based on their **non-penalty expected goals (npxG) overperformance** — a metric that compares how many goals a player scored vs. how many they were expected to score (excluding penalties).

📊 The analysis focuses on:
- Forwards with **above-median minutes** played
- **Overperformance** = `npG - npxG`
- Visualized using Python and matplotlib

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Bryan Mbeumo**, **Matheus Cunha**, and **Ayoze Pérez** top the list of overperformers
- Each player's output is visualized with:
  - 📈 A ranked table
  - 🔵 A scatter plot of `npxG` vs. `npG`  
    (circle size = minutes played)
